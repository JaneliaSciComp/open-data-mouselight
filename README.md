# open-data-mouselight
MouseLight Gen1 Imagery hosted on AWS Open Data 

## Overview

This repository contains static files for MouseLight's AWS Open Data. These folder are mirrored on S3 with each top-level folder corresponding to a public bucket:
* [janelia-mouselight-imagery](janelia-mouselight-imagery/README.md)

## Implementation notes

* The Markdown used in this repo contains footnotes, which are [not supported by Github](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/498), so they will not render correctly in the Github preview. The actual publication target for these README's is [Quilt](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/janelia-mouselight-imagery) which does support footnotes.
